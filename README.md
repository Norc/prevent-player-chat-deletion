# Prevent Player Chat Deletion
A simple module that removes the ability of non-GM users to delete their own chat messages.

Typically, when a player right-clicks a chat message they sent, a context menu displays containing two options:

1. Make Private / Reveal to Everyone (eye icon)
2. Delete (trash can icon)

This module prevents the second option from displaying to the player, making it impossible for them to click.
